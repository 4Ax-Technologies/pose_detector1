# Pose Detector

__Pose Detector__ is a pose estimation network used by the 4Ax __VR__ simulation/game controller to detect poses and map outcomes to game engine action and 
physics modes. In prototyping the default game engine was __UE5__ (Unreal Engine 5).

A major issue in building this model, it turns out, is computational overhead. Examples of tjis include:
* __COCO 2017__ database is more than 25 Gb in size, and comprises 80 classes. BodyPose detction only requites "person" class, (class 1). It may be prudent
  to consider this before running the "train data" link in the Nvidia jupyter notebook
* downloading a single class via [FiftyOne](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/dataset_zoo/datasets.html) requires a download of the FiftyOne API and also
  requires the unwrapping of the 64115 .jpg images for the "person" class. The template code for this approach is included [here](
* downloading the images direct to a local machine is highly dependant on internet bandwidth and in cases where bandwidth is sub-optimal the process may be
  "killed".
