# Pose Detector

__Pose Detector__ is a pose estimation network used by the 4Ax __VR__ simulation/game controller to detect poses and map outcomes to game engine action and 
physics modes. In prototyping the default game engine was __UE5__ (Unreal Engine 5).

A major issue in building this model, it turns out, is computational overhead. Examples of this include:
* __COCO 2017__ database is more than 25 Gb in size, and comprises 80 classes. BodyPose detection only requites "person" class, (class 1). It may be prudent
  to consider this before running the "train data" link in the Nvidia jupyter notebook
* downloading a single class via [FiftyOne](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/dataset_zoo/datasets.html) requires a download of the FiftyOne API and also
  requires the unwrapping of the 64115 .jpg images for the "person" class. The template code for this approach is included [here](https://github.com/4Ax-Technologies/pose_detector1/blob/unpickme-patch-1/FiftyOne_download.py)
* downloading the images direct to a local machine is dependant on available internet bandwidth and in cases where bandwidth is sub-optimal the process may be
  "killed". A smaller set of images can be downloaded by using [coco_person_data.py](https://github.com/4Ax-Technologies/pose_detector1/blob/unpickme-patch-1/coco_person_data.py)
  and setting the "smallset" value (line 44) to a value less than 64115.
* images download as a .zip . coco_person_data.py uses zipfile which has an limit for extraction file size of 4 Gb. This equates to roughly 4000 images.
* To download a larger set, the preferred route is to download to a cloud-based storage and unzip the .zip there.
