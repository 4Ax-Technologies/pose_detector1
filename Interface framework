# Define function to process pose estimation output
def process_pose_output(pose_output):
    # Parse pose output and extract relevant information
    # This could include joint positions, angles, gestures, and class information

    # Example:
    joint_positions = pose_output["joint_positions"]
    gestures = pose_output["gestures"]
    pose_class = pose_output["pose_class"]
    
    # Perform any necessary processing or transformations

# Define function to send pose information to Unreal Engine
def send_pose_to_unreal(joint_positions, gestures, pose_class):
    # Construct scripts or messages interpreted by Unreal Engine
    # This could involve creating animations, triggering events, or updating character state
    
    # Example:
    # Construct scripts to update character animation based on joint positions, gestures, and pose class
    animation_script = construct_animation_script(joint_positions, gestures, pose_class)

def construct_animation_script(joint_positions, gestures, pose_class):
    # Construct animation script based on joint positions, gestures, and pose class
    # This could involve mapping joint positions to bone animations, defining animation sequences, etc.

    script = f"SetAnimation('idle')"

        script += f"\nSetAnimation('standing')"
